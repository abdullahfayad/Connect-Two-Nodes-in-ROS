To create a ROS workspace you should follow these steps:
1- Create a folder with the name that you want
2- Inside it, create a folder with the name ‘src’, and type this command “catkin_init_workspace”
3- Go back to the root and type this command “catkin_make”, if you work with python3 as in my case 
so you should type this command instead of the previous one “catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3”

All these steps are shown in the figure “workspace.png”.

To create a package all you should do is typing the following commands in the root :
1- “catkin_create_pkg robot rospy roscpp std_msgs”
2- “catkin_make”

To create a node inside a package you have to create a folder inside this package called “scripts” for example, 
inside this folder you can create python files (nodes) like node1.py and node2.py
